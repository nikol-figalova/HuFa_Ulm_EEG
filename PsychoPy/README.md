This folder contains an example of a three-stimulus novelty auditory oddball task running in PsychoPy.  
The project streams the markers over local network using LSL. You can use this to synchronise the LSL and EEG streams.  
You must install all the software necessary in order to make this run. You will need to install pylsl (the Python interface of LSL).
